        The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived
        from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate
        disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In
        ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of
        the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic
        characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to
        develop of their own accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the
        physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original
        notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by
        pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension
        then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever
        since.

        During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several
        centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by
        divine laws.[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly
        became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional
        intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions
        (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine
        providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of
        nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time,
        especially after Charles Darwin.

        Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to
        geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living
        plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with
        inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and
        change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the
        Earth.
